# Summer_Research_Internship_CADS
This contains the concepts and implementations of some baseline Reinforcement Learning Algorithms and Continual Learning during my tenure as a Summer Research Intern at the Centre for Advanced Data Science (Vellore Institute of Technology Chennai Campus). 

The implementations and concepts learnt during these are from a combination of Research Papers and a course based on Advanced Reinforcement Learning.

The environment used for the agent here in these algorithms is the 'LunarLander-v2' rendered by the OpenAI gym and all models are in PyTorch.
